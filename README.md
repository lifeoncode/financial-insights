<h1>FINANCIAL INSIGHTS</h1>
<p>This application allows users to visualize their finances to (hopefully) get a better understanding of their income and expenditure.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>As a user, you enter details such as your name, surname and date of birth. Then you need to upload an excel spreadsheet file containing income and expenses information for a given numbe of months.<br>The application reads this information and gives you a visual representation of it in the form of an interactive graph.</p>

<h3>How to run on local machine</h3>
<p>If you prefer to use this application with the cource (i.e run it from your local machine), the steps below outline how you can do exactly that.</p>
<p><strong><em>NOTE: There are a few things you'll need to have installed on your computer to run the application:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Node.Js</strong> (this app is built in Javascript, you'll need Node to run the server on your computer)</li>
<li><strong>Text editor</strong> (this is not exactly required, but if you're gonna dive in the source code, then you'll need some sort of text editor/IDE such as VScode)</li>
<li><strong>Command line or Terminal</strong> (you'll need this to execute script files and install dependencies the great thing about having an IDE/text editor is that it has an in-built terminal)</li>
<li><strong>Web browser</strong> (when you run the application, it will open your default web browser, make sure you have one installed)</li>
</ul>
